Its reckless nature was not it's most defining feature, however; it was its nuturing and friendly nature that made it unique among the early hives. Whenever it encountered another mind, it would attempt to form a symbiotic link with it, though this behavior rarely succeeded immediately. The Tsan'tai gained many allies in the form of smaller, less dominant hives, which it would nurture and grow in exchange for its continued support.
